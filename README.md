# Poké Brawl

Poke Brawl is a Pokémon based battle simulation game where you compete against the computer. It's similar to a Pokémon battle in the sense that it has two players that each take turns attacking each other and each player has a health that starts off at 100%. Player 1, either the computer or you start off and pick a Pokémon type (For simplicity, the types are gonna be: fire, water, grass, normal, fighting, ground, electric, poison, flying and ghost). That is your type now. Then player 2 picks a type. If player 2's type has a 0 damage on player 1's type, then player 1's health stays the same. If the damage is 1/2x, then player 1's health drops by 10%. If the damage is 1x, then player 1's health drops by 20% and if the damage is 2x the damage, meaning it's super effective, then player 1's health drops by 40%. A reference to all the Pokémon types and damages can be found [here](https://pokemondb.net/type). Once a player's health is <= 0, then that player loses.
